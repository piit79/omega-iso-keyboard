# OmegaISO Keyboard

OmegaISO is a meme board with a WKL TKL-like layout consisting entirely of ISO Enter keys. Dreamed up by Elia#2178, the PCB was designed by piit79 of 42. Keebs to help with the project.

### Features
* WKL TKL-like layout with 94 ISO Enter keys (sadly there's no "ISO spacebar"...;))
* Uses Kailh hotswap sockets
* 4 up facing RGB LEDs above the arrow cluster for logo backlight
* Based on the [42. Keebs Frood](https://42keebs.eu/shop/parts/controllers/frood-rp2040-pro-micro-controller/) RP2040 controller
